**Pneumonia Detection from X-Ray Images**
This project leverages deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images, aiming to provide accurate and efficient diagnostics to aid medical professionals.

**Features**
**Deep Learning Model:** A robust deep learning model trained on chest X-ray images to identify pneumonia with high accuracy.
**Web Application:** The model is deployed using Flask, allowing easy access through a user-friendly web interface.
**Medical Utility:** Designed to assist in early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia.
**Project files**
ModelDev.ipynb:** Contains the notebook for training and evaluating the deep learning model.
Flask Application: Integrates the model into a lightweight web application for real-world usage.


**Usage**
Upload a chest X-ray image through the web interface.
The model analyzes the image and provides a prediction (Pneumonia or Normal).
